<p>What is Performacology?</p>

<p>Performacology is three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a fresh take on the study of performance testing and engineering practices, with an emphasis on sustainable engineering</li>
  <li>a re-thinking of certification programs on performance for testers, developers and engineering leadership</li>
  <li>an open-source library for performance-related research and learning; a deep archive of lessons, experience reports, papers, podcasts, video tutorials - all shared for free under Creative Commons licensing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s an open-source, community-driven certification program for performance testing and engineering professionals. The program leverages the collaborative aspects of open-source software development while disrupting the traditional schemes of for-profit IT training and certification programs. The value of a Performacology certification is derived from the ever-evolving contributions of the community of our peers.</p>

<p>Certification can be useful in your journey as a performance professional, but it’s never an endpoint in and of itself. For too many years, professional certifictation in the tech industry has become a revenue-driven, gatekeeping boondoggle resulting in the exclusive elevation of the few or privileged. Performacology endeavors to re-invent certification for performance professionals in a much more collaborative and supportive way.</p>
