What is Performacology?

Performacology is three things:
  - a fresh take on the study of performance testing and engineering practices, with an emphasis on sustainable engineering
  - a re-thinking of certification programs on performance for testers, developers and engineering leadership
  - an open-source library for performance-related research and learning; a deep archive of lessons, experience reports, papers, podcasts, video tutorials - all shared for free under Creative Commons licensing.

It's an open-source, community-driven certification program for performance testing and engineering professionals. The program leverages the collaborative aspects of open-source software development while disrupting the traditional schemes of for-profit IT training and certification programs. The value of a Performacology certification is derived from the ever-evolving contributions of the community of our peers.

Certification can be useful in your journey as a performance professional, but it's never an endpoint in and of itself. For too many years, professional certifictation in the tech industry has become a revenue-driven, gatekeeping boondoggle resulting in the exclusive elevation of the few or privileged. Performacology endeavors to re-invent certification for performance professionals in a much more collaborative and supportive way.
